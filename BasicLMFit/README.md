# Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) Fit 

Currently, this is a skeleton of an implementation of the LM algorithm
for curve fitting.

The program generates a waverform, prints it out, and runs through an outline
of the LM algorithm that doesn't really do anything yet. 

## To Build
gcc main.c dataSim.c -lm

## To Run   
./a.out
