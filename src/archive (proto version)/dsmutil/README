The dsmutil package is built to support the R&D test efforts at DSM. The package
aims to store useful code in a generic form for a wide range of use at DSM.
While the package is only deployed in python, it should integrate tightly with
excel and sqlite datafiles.

The dsmutil package follows some standard convention internally, and the use of
the package will be greatly aided by the developer following these conventions.

1. Data is presented to functions as pandas DataFrames for reliable mutability,
   quick and specific manipulation, and calculation speeds.

2. Object methods follow a get_ and set_ function format.

3. function naming convention follows the verb_noun format with multi-word nouns
   using the verb_multiNoun format. If no verb is present, noun only format is
   used and is identical to previous examples.

4. communication objects should be used in a closed loop workflow, where
   connection status and dataflow are monitored at the beginning of every loop.

5. Relevant functions are stored together in parent module and referenced
   relative to the parent. If the fft module has calc_qFactor and calc_deltaMag
   functions. The developer would call them as

   import dsmutil.fft as fft
   x = fft.calc_qFactor()
   y = fft.calc_deltaMag()

6. configuration setting functions are kept separate from generic connection
   or communication functions. When in doubt, think generic use cases.
